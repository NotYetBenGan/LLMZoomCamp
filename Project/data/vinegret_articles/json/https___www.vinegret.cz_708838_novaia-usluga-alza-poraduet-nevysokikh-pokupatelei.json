        "The largest Czech online store Alza.cz has introduced an innovation aimed at simplifying the process of receiving parcels from AlzaBox parcel lockers.",
        "Now when placing an order, customers can choose delivery to the lower rows of cells. In this case, the courier will place the parcel in a box located at a maximum height of 140 cm from the ground.",
        "The service is completely free. To activate it, simply check the box next to \"Preferuji spodní schránku\".",
        "\"We realize that accessibility is crucial, and we are constantly looking for ways to improve the customer experience. The launch of low-altitude delivery at AlzaBox is another step towards making our services as convenient and accessible as possible for everyone,\" said Elishka Cherovska, a representative of the online store.",
        "In some cases, when it is not possible to place an order at a low height, the customer will receive an SMS notification indicating the actual locker where the package was placed.",
        "Today, there are over 2850 AlzaBox parcel lockers installed throughout the Czech Republic, and their number is constantly growing. Moreover, the company collaborates with other courier services and provides its lockers to companies such as PPL, Balíkovna (Česká pošta), or DPD.",
        "Therefore, Alza offers a new feature not only to its customers, but also to the clients of its partners.",
        "\"We want to simplify the process of receiving shipments for all customers, so we ask carriers to support this feature along with us,\" Chervoska added.",
