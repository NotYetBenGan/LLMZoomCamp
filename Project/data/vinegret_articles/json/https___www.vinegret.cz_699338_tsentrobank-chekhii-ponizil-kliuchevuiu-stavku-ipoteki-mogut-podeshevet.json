        "On Thursday, February 6, the Czech National Bank (ČNB) lowered the key rate by 0.25% to 3.75%. The financial market was expecting this move, so it reacted almost no reaction. The crown exchange rate remained unchanged.",
        "Lowering the key rate gives banks room to lower consumer and mortgage loans. However, how significant it will be depends on the strategy of each specific financial institution.",
        "The flip side of the coin is that interest rates on savings deposits will definitely decrease, making storing money in banks less profitable. Another unpleasant aspect is that the decreasing mortgage rates are increasingly boosting the pent-up demand for real estate, which accelerates its price increase.",
        "The last time the key interest rate in the Czech Republic was at 3.75% was in January 2022.",
        "The head of the Central Bank, Ales Michl, stated that the regulator will approach further reduction of the key rate extremely cautiously. The process can be stopped at any moment, as the Czech economy is recovering slowly and still below its potential.",
        "\"The opportunity to lower the rate was created by inflation returning to the range that the Central Bank considers acceptable. Considering that significant inflation risks persist, especially in the services sector, a cautious approach by the central bank is fully justified. That is why we will most likely see one or two more rate cuts this year and then a pause,\" commented Petr Dufek, the chief economist of Creditas bank, on the regulator's decision.",
