        "The Prague concert of the Russian rap artist Morgenshtern, which was supposed to take place on April 2, has been postponed for understandable reasons. This was announced by the event organizing company.",
        "The new concert date is October 15, 2022. The venue remains the same - the small sports arena Výstaviště (Mala Sportovni Hala, Za Elektrárnou 170 00).",
        "All previously purchased tickets remain valid. Those who wish to get a refund can do so by following the instructions at this link.",
        "Tickets for the October concert can be purchased on the organizer's website.",
        "Let's remind that in June 2021, Russian authorities fined the controversial performer 100,000 rubles, seeing signs of drug propaganda in the music videos \"Pink Wine - 2\" and \"Family.\" In the fall, the head of the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation, Alexander Bastrykin, even stated that Morgenshtern \"is selling drugs on social media.\" However, no evidence or facts were provided by the official. After this, the rapper left Russia and is currently living in Dubai.",
