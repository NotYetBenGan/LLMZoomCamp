        "In the Czech Republic, the \"European Heritage Days\" (Dny evropského dědictví 2025) have started. As part of the annual event, all interested individuals can visit hundreds of historical sites for free or at a reduced cost throughout September, including those that are usually closed to the general public.",
        "The festival is held under the patronage of the Association of Historical Monuments of the Czech Republic, Moravia, and Silesia.",
        "🕓 In 2025, it will last not seven days (as before), but for a whole month - from September 1st to September 30th.",
        "🆓 Nearly 700 state-protected objects are participating in the promotion. The majority of them (but not all) will completely waive the entrance fee on selected days.",
        "These are not only castles, palaces, churches, monasteries, museums, theaters, old houses, gardens, villas, but also industrial buildings - factories, mills, breweries, craft workshops, mines.",
        "👉 The list of participating venues, their schedules, and dates of participation in the festival can be viewed on the event's website.",
        "The main theme of the current festival is \"Architectural Heritage.\" Visitors can expect a rich accompanying program - classical music concerts, unusual excursions, exhibitions, markets, creative contests, and much more.",
        "\"Times are changing, and the city changes with them. We would hardly recognize many corners of Ceske Budejovice if we were to find ourselves, let's say, during the times of Maria Theresa, and the citizen of that time, in turn, would be amazed at how the city looked during the rule of Charles IV.\"",
        "Nevertheless, some places remain preserved over the centuries. As buildings age, they become landmarks deserving of our attention not only because of their age, but also as witnesses of past events and ways of life. However, it took many generations for people to fully realize this idea.",
        "Only at the moment when the memorable structures disappeared like spring snow, a certain emptiness and nostalgia for old times appeared in the soul of modern man. It was then that an interest in monuments and their preservation arose, initially perhaps more romantic, but increasingly supported by professional research, which eventually grew into the European Heritage Days,\" noted the festival organizers.",
        "The official opening ceremony will take place in the city of Ceske Budejovice on September 13th.",
