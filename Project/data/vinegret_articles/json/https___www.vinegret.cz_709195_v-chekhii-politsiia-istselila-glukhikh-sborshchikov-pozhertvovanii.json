        "In the Czech city of Pilsen, three fraudsters pretended to be deaf and collected donations from passersby, allegedly for a fund to help people with hearing impairments. The incident occurred on Wednesday, September 3rd.",
        "The police detained men aged 18, 20, and 47 on Folmavská Street in front of the shopping center.",
        "\"At first, they pretended to be deaf and mute - they refused to communicate with us and show their documents. However, after some time, they realized that excuses wouldn't work, and suddenly started talking.\"",
        "They had a paper with them with the inscription: \"Regional certificate for the deaf and people with disabilities, as well as for poor children. We want to open an international center, thank you.\"",
        "The form contained a list of donations, poorly made prints, and logos designed to inspire trust in donors. The men claimed that they had come to the Czech Republic for just two days and needed money for a trip to Germany. \"They were collecting cash right into their trouser pockets,\" said police representative Tereza Vaidl.",
        "While the patrol officers were dealing with the scammers, a man approached them and claimed that he had just given 200 crowns to a trio because he believed the money would go to those in need. Another passerby told them that the collectors had offered her to send money through a QR code on a smartphone, but she refused.",
        "\"The whole 'collection' was far from legal. The men had their collected cash and mobile phone with a QR code confiscated. A report on the incident will be forwarded to the administrative body for further investigation,\" Vaidl added.",
