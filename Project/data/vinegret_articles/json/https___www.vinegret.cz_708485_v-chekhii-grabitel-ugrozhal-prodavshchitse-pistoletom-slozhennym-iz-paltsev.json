        "The police of the Ustecky region of the Czech Republic has registered a serious contender for the title of the dumbest robbery of the year. In the city of Most, an unknown man entered a tobacco kiosk and demanded money from the cashier, threatening her with palms folded into the shape of a gun.",
        "In response, the woman advised the burglar to leave and also warned him that there is video surveillance in the building.",
        "In the end, the man had no choice but to retreat. But before leaving, he decided to save his \"thief's honor\" after all - so as not to leave completely empty-handed, he grabbed a few lighters and packs of rolling paper from the counter.",
        "Now the offender faces 2 to 10 years in prison for the crime of \"robbery.\" Was the stolen loot worth such a risk - a rhetorical question.",
        "The crime occurred on August 12 around 05:15 on Vítězslava Nezvala Street. Investigators have not yet been able to identify the robber. Therefore, they are asking anyone who recognizes the man in the video to call the number 158.",
