        "The police of the city of Karlovy Vary easily found two thieves who broke into someone else's apartment on the evening of August 9th and stole valuable items from it. One of the burglars inadvertently helped the investigators by leaving a bag-purse at the crime scene, which contained his ID card (občanský průkaz), insurance policy, and various loyalty program cards.",
