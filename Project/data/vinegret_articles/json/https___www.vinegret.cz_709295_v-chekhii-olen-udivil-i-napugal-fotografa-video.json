        "The photographer was walking in the Czech national park Šumava (NP Šumava) when he heard a rustle. In a moment, a wild deer jumped out from behind the trees.",
        "\"You're standing on a stump, contemplating how to capture a beautiful shot, and then something rustled in the spruce grove, and this handsome guy jumped out. At first, it seemed like he was heading straight towards me, but I don't know why, I didn't flinch and kept shooting, frozen in place.\"",
        "\"With graceful jumps, he ran alongside me (approximately 1.5 meters away) and continued on his way... I suppose that since I hadn't moved the whole time, he didn't recognize me. In any case, the heart rate was very high 🙂,\" said the author of the video, Vaclav Shtetina.",
