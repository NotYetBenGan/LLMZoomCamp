        "On Saturday, March 26, a march \"Russians against Putin\" will take place in the center of Prague. The gathering point for participants will be Namesti Miru Square, from where at 1:00 PM the demonstrators will head towards the Old Town Square.",
        "The organizer is the \"Prague Russian Anti-War Committee\".",
        "\"Friends! We need this action. Russian citizens in the Czech Republic should have the opportunity to loudly and massively say: \"No to war\", \"No to Putin\", \"We stand with Ukraine\", \"We stand with the Czech Republic, Europe, and the whole world against Russian aggression.\" The Czechs are waiting for this. It is necessary to make it clear that Russians in Prague, people of different nationalities, are part of Czech society, not secret supporters of Putinism. Many of us are already engaged in important activities to help refugees and other useful tasks. But let's spend time and effort once to make our collective voice heard publicly,\" the description of the action says.",
