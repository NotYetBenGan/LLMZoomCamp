        "In the second quarter of 2025, the cost of renting apartments in the Czech Republic increased on average by 3% and amounted to 373 Czech crowns per square meter. The highest growth was observed in the PlzeÅˆ Region, where prices rose by 4%. These data are contained in a study by the popular online advertising platform Bezrealitky.cz, published by the ÄŒTK agency.",
        "The report indicates that rental payments in the Czech Republic continue to rise, but not as significantly as in previous months. The number of applicants has decreased, while the duration of stay in rental housing has increased. The region with the highest prices and the highest demand for rental housing has once again become the capital.",
        "In Prague, the rent for apartments has increased on average by 3% to 440 Czech crowns per square meter. The most expensive apartments per square meter were small layout apartments of 1+kk and 2+kk, while large apartments turned out to be the cheapest. The average \"family\" apartment with an area of 65 square meters was rented out on average for 28,600 crowns per month.",
        "Compared to the first quarter, the number of housing applicants in the capital has decreased from 100 to 72 people per listing. This is still a very high figure, but it is worth noting that people usually look at several properties simultaneously.",
        "The South Moravian Region, where a significant portion of rental housing is located in Brno, has seen a price increase of 1.2% to 333 Czech crowns per square meter. Small apartments with good transportation accessibility to the city center are particularly in demand here. The rising prices are forcing people to accept many inconveniences, including longer commuting times from home to work.",
        "In the Central Bohemian Region, in the second quarter, the rent increased by 1% to 301 Czech crowns per square meter. The most expensive are the settlements located in close proximity to Prague and having direct railway connections with it. In the cities on the outer borders of the region, prices have slightly decreased.",
        "The highest growth in rental prices was recorded in the Pilsen Region. Prices there increased by 4% to 278 crowns per square meter. An average apartment with an area of 65 square meters was rented out for 18,000 crowns per month. Analysts from Bezrealitky expect that Pilsen is one of those regional cities where intensive rent increases will continue in the coming months.",
        "Rental prices have also increased in the South Bohemian, Pardubice, Hradec Kralove, and Liberec regions. On the contrary, they have decreased in the Usti, Karlovy Vary, and Olomouc regions.",
        "According to Bezrealitka, the search period for a rental apartment has slightly increased again. In the second quarter, applicants spent an average of 6 weeks searching for suitable housing, and in Prague, about two months. This is due to the fact that there are fewer listings on the market, and households are staying in their current accommodation longer. According to the platform's estimates, the average duration of staying in one rental apartment is 4 years.",
