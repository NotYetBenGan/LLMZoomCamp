        "The iconic German band Rammstein will perform in Prague. The concert will take place outdoors at the Letňany Airport (letiště Letňany) on May 11, 2024. The musicians will perform songs from their latest album, as well as timeless hits.",
        "Ticket sales starting from 1990 crowns will begin on October 18 at 11:00. They can be purchased through Ticketportal and Ticketmaster networks. All tickets are personalized (you need to provide a name when purchasing), meaning they cannot be transferred to another person.",
        "Let's note that the last two visits of Rammstein to Prague were accompanied by very high demand, which led to the organization of additional concerts. In 2019, the band played two nights in a row at the \"EDEN Arena\" stadium, and in 2022, they played two nights in a row at the \"Letňany\" aerodrome.",
        "It is possible that this time Rammstein will give an additional concert if all tickets for May 11 sell out quickly.",
        "Let's remind that in 2022, fans of the band who couldn't attend either of the two performances and came to \"stand nearby\" trampled the sugar beet field, causing serious damage to the Prague company VIN Agro. Each of the two concerts gathered around 60,000 spectators.",
