        "The housing situation in the Czech Republic has become extremely unfriendly not only in the buying and selling market but also in the long-term rental segment. The demand is so high that apartment owners are setting strict requirements that not every potential tenant can meet.",
        "In particular, they require a higher refundable deposit in case of damage to furniture, appliances, and other housing equipment. Today, it is common practice for the deposit to reach two times the rental rate, although just a year ago tenants' appetites were more modest - the deposit usually equaled one rental payment or even 50%.",
        "In today's reality, it is extremely difficult to rent a property directly from the owner. Such options are quickly taken or there is a huge queue of other applicants. As a result, one has to turn to a real estate agent, whose commission usually equals the amount of one month's rent.",
        "In Prague and Brno, the situation is the worst.",
        "Considering that today in major Czech cities the rent for apartments of the most popular layout 2KK averages 25,000 crowns, a potential tenant will need to pay an additional 100,000 crowns before moving in. This means paying 25,000 crowns to the real estate agent, 25,000 crowns for the first month of living, and another 50,000 crowns as a security deposit.",
        "\"I saw ads where the landlord asked for three rental payments as a deposit, but this is more of an exception,\" Mr. Marek told Novinky portal, who visited about 15 properties in search of a three-bedroom apartment for his family in Prague.",
        "The rent in the Czech Republic increased on average by 6% in 2024, while in the capital it rose by almost 9%. Today, the average cost of one square meter in Prague is 422 Czech crowns per month for tenants. This means that for a typical three-bedroom apartment with an area of about 70 square meters, tenants have to pay 29,500 crowns monthly. This amount does not include utility bills.",
        "For families where both parents work, the main issue becomes not even the monthly payment, but the initial amount that needs to be paid when moving in.",
        "The commission as an indicator of the solvency and reliability of the tenant",
        "Apartment owners turn to realtors for several quite obvious reasons - they save time, show the property themselves, and handle all the formalities with the lease agreement. And all this is free - the realtor's commission is paid by the future tenant.",
        "\"Strange that I pay the realtor, but he defends the interests not of mine, but of the landlord,\" Marek says in surprise.",
        "However, it was not always like this in the Czech Republic.",
        "\"When I started in 2008, it was common for landlords to pay the commission. Today, in 99% of cases, it is paid by the tenant,\" confirmed Jan Martina, a realtor at M&M Reality company.",
        "According to him, apartment owners consider tenants' willingness to pay the realtor's commission as an indicator of their financial capability. In other words, as part of a kind of test that allows them to ensure that a potential tenant has the money and will not have problems with rent payment in the future.",
        "High demand plays into the hands of landlords.",
        "Realtors agree that apartment owners have become much more demanding when choosing tenants. This has become possible due to high demand.",
        "\"Owners prefer not those who were the first to respond to the listing and submit an application for the apartment, but those who can provide as much information about themselves or their family as possible,\" said Martin Ponzer, director of the online real estate classifieds service Bezrealitky.",
        "Given the authorities' total inability to solve the housing crisis, which has been worsening for 11 years already, the situation with renting apartments in the Czech Republic is unlikely to change in the coming years.",
