        "In spring 2024, the iconic German band Rammstein will perform in Prague once again. All tickets for the previously announced concert on May 11 were sold out within minutes after going on sale. Therefore, the musicians decided to hold a second concert on May 12. Both performances will take place outdoors at the Letňany aerodrome.",
        "Tickets for the additional center are now available for purchase on Ticketportal and Ticketmaster networks. The price starts from 1990 crowns. All tickets are personalized (you need to provide a name when purchasing), which means they cannot be transferred to another person.",
        "It should be noted that adding a second concert was expected - Rammstein's recent visits to Prague have been accompanied by very high demand, which led to the organization of additional concerts. For example, in 2019, the band played two nights in a row at the \"EDEN Arena\" stadium, and in 2022, they played two nights in a row at the \"Letňany\" aerodrome.",
        "Let's remind that in 2022, fans of the band who couldn't attend any of the two performances and came to \"stand nearby\" trampled the sugar beet field, causing serious damage to the Prague company VIN Agro. Each of the two concerts gathered around 60,000 spectators.",
