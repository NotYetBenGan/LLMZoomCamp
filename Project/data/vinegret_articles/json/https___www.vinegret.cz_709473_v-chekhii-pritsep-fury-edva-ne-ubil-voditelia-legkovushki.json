        "A 57-year-old driver of a Citroën car can talk about luck in misfortune. On the morning of September 10, he was driving through the village of Studnice (near Vysočina region). A trailer from an oncoming truck unexpectedly overturned on him.",
        "Despite serious damage to the car, the driver himself was not injured. The damage was preliminarily estimated at 400,000 crowns.",
        "\"According to preliminary information, the trailer of the truck started swaying and overturned onto a nearby passenger car. At the same time, the container being transported on the trailer fell in the opposite direction beyond the roadway,\" said police representative Michaela Lebrova.",
        "If a multi-ton container of garbage had fallen on the Citroen, the consequences could have been much sadder. The alcohol tests for both drivers turned out to be negative.",
        "\"We resolved the incident with the 37-year-old truck driver on the spot by imposing a fine,\" Lebrova added.",
