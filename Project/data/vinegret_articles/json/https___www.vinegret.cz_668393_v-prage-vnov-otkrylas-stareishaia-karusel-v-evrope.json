        "On Thursday, May 1st, in Prague, after the winter break, the \"Letenská Carousel\" (Letenský kolotoč) reopened to visitors. It is a protected cultural monument and one of the two oldest floor-mounted carousels in Europe.",
        "The attraction, built in 1892, operated until 2006 when authorities banned its operation due to its dismal technical condition. In 2004, the National Technical Museum purchased the object from a private owner, and restoration work began at that time. It lasted for 16 years and cost 22.7 million crowns. Some of the funds were allocated by the state, while the rest were raised through donations.",
        "The carousel consists of 19 wooden horses covered with natural horsehide, and a central column with three sculptures of knights in papier-mâché armor, covered with silver paint. It was first unveiled to the townspeople after restoration in the summer of 2022.",
        "🕓 Attraction schedule:",
        "In 2025, the carousel is only open on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, as well as on public holidays.",
        "01.05.2025 - 28.09.2025, from 11:00 to 17:00.",
        "🎫 Price: 120 crowns for one trip lasting 5 minutes. Tickets are only sold at the ticket office on site.",
