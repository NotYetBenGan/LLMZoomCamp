        "Admission to a medical university is an extremely challenging task, especially abroad. The Czech Republic is one of the few countries that offer foreigners the opportunity to receive higher education for free, but on the condition that the education is conducted in Czech.",
        "Moreover, you can study for free not just anywhere, but at the most prestigious universities in the country, one of which is the legendary Charles University. How can one become a part of this elite club?",
        "Today we will tell the story of two medical students who challenged language schools and created the first independent preparation courses for foreigners in medicine called NaMed.\n\nWhy Czech Republic?",
        "The Czech Republic offers high-quality medical education that is recognized in many countries around the world. The medical faculties of Czech universities are known for their modern educational programs, highly qualified teaching staff, and excellent clinical practice.",
        "Admission to medical faculties in the Czech Republic is a serious challenge that requires not only academic knowledge but also high motivation. Currently, medical education can be obtained at four universities: Charles University, Masaryk University, Palacky University in Olomouc, and Ostrava University. Each of them has several medical faculties, which in total amounts to eight faculties with a medical profile.",
        "The NaMED School was founded by medical students, who are now practicing doctors and graduates of the first medical faculty of Charles University. They have created preparatory courses for motivated young people willing to work hard to achieve their goal of the coveted white coat.",
        "The initial idea is simple - to become a lifebuoy, to give applicants what large language schools promised in their brochures but could not provide due to underestimating the complexity of the medical field. After five years of existence, NaMED remains the first independent preparatory course for foreigners, both in terms of its founding date and in terms of quality and success.",
        "How did the school appear?",
        "NaMED was founded in 2018 by friends Alexander Melnik and Sasha Krivosheev, who were fourth-year students at Charles University at that time. They combined their accumulated experience to help applicants avoid unnecessary mistakes, prepare as efficiently as possible in all subjects, and enter university with minimal stress.",
        "Alexander moved to the Czech Republic at the age of 18 and faced difficulties in adaptation, starting with the language barrier, which undoubtedly affected his approach to course development. Meanwhile, Sasha, who has been living in the country since childhood, knew the Czech education system from the inside and could offer valuable insights.",
        "Together, they developed a program that takes into account all aspects of preparation, including the specifics of the Czech language, challenging exams, and unique requirements of medical faculties.",
        "Development of NaMED",
        "The history of NaMED started with a short video on a YouTube channel and two ambitious guys. The program they created turned out to be so popular and effective that Alexander and Sasha were able to expand their team to eight teachers, each of whom has gone through the admission process themselves and understands the specifics of their faculty.",
        "Each of them brings their professional knowledge and experience to the courses, allowing the school to constantly improve its methods and update the program in accordance with the latest changes in admission requirements.",
        "In 2024, in collaboration with several dozen medical students, NaMed created an unparalleled platform for preparation, which includes thousands of entrance exam questions with detailed explanations.",

        "All necessary literature is provided.",
