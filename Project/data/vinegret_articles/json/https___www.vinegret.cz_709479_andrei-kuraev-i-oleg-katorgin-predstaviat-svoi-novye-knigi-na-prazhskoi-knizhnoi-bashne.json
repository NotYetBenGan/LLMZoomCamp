        "On Sunday, September 14, Deacon Andrey Kurayev will take part in the \"Prague Book Tower\" fair, where he will present his new books \"Mythology of Russian Wars\" (2024) and \"Sacred Wars of the Orthodox World\" (2025).",
        "🕐 The presentation will take place from 13:00 to 14:00 on the small stage.",
        "🆓 Free admission. Everyone is welcome.",
        "\"The Mythology of Russian Wars\"",
        "A mosaic of facts from Russian military history. The largest land power in the world praises itself as the most peaceful. And this mosaic is assembled in order to logically counter the myth of its own harmlessness that is spread by the state and church propaganda of Russia.",
        "The author suggests reflecting on both texts and facts known from school days (\"why did Mtsyri become an orphan?\") and on many little-known episodes of Russian military glory and disgrace.",
        "\"The Holy Wars of the Orthodox World\"",
        "In Russia, a ban on self-awareness has been introduced. It is ordered to consider oneself a perpetual victim of others' aggressions, sometimes only giving in. We are supposedly never engaged in crusades or waged holy wars.",
        "This question is not limited to purely intra-church matters. If religion is considered the most important part of the \"cultural code,\" it is important to know not only the self-promotional videos of this religion, but also its real history. The author reflects on what standards of military ethics, rhetoric, and politics the Orthodox Church generates and reproduces from century to century.",
        "On Saturday, September 13th, the writer Alexander Delfinov and the Prague artist Oleg Katorgin, performing under the creative pseudonym Herman Grott, will present their joint book \"The Hidden Chura\" at the fair.",
        "🕒 The presentation will take place from 3:00 PM to 3:45 PM.",
        "🆓 Free entry.",
        "\"The Hidden Chura\" is an enhanced, corrected, and richly illustrated second edition of a book of stories about ghosts and werewolves, connected by a forgotten underground river. More than thirty texts, as separate chapters, converge into a single narrative, a kind of series. And thanks to the illustrations by Oleg Katorgin, it is visualized in a truly magnificent way.",
        "In addition, at the Fresh Verlag publishing stand, you will be able to familiarize yourself with the book \"With Mom in Antarctica,\" which was written and designed single-handedly by Oleg Katorgin, who lived for 1.5 years at a polar station.",
        "📍 The exhibition-fair \"Prague Book Tower\" will take place at the Spojka Karlin venue (Pernerova 697/35, Praha 8, Karlín) next weekend from September 12 to 14. The working hours are from 10:00 to 21:30.",
        "The fair for three days will become a meeting place with new and already known immigrant publishers, authors, independent bookstores, magazines, and most importantly - with reading enthusiasts.",
        "ℹ️ Visitors will not only be able to purchase new books at publisher prices, but also communicate with writers, attend various lectures, and other educational events.",
        "This is also a great opportunity to get acquainted with the works of Prague writers and artists. Among them are Andrey Shary, Ivan Tolstoy, Oleg Katorgin, Yevgeny Demenok, Igor Pomerantsev, Boris Belenkin, Ivan Rychlov, Nina Skepyan, Pavel Kotov, Andrey Kuraev, Tomash Glanz, and Max Shchur.",
        "👉 Entry to the fair and accompanying events are free of charge. Organizers have prepared a separate program for children. Detailed schedule is available here.",
