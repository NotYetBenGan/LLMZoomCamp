        "In the Czech city of Pilsen, the driver creatively paid a fine for a traffic violation by folding one of the banknotes into origami right in front of the police officers.",
        "\"Patrol officers encounter people of all different characters during their shifts. Sometimes the situation is tense, sometimes complex and requires a lot of patience. And sometimes, someone can pleasantly surprise us.\"",
        "This recently happened at the pool in the Slovany area. The driver violated traffic rules and received a fine of 200 crowns. The proceedings themselves were calm and with a touch of humor, but the most interesting thing happened when the man was paying the fine.",
        "\"He carefully folded one of the banknotes into an origami in the shape of a little shirt. This original gesture turned a mundane situation into something that brought a smile and once again reminded us how humor can be applied to such a situation,\" the police press service said.",
