        "On Sunday, August 31, for the first time in a quarter of a century, the speed limit for regular passenger transportation on the Czech railway was changed. It was increased from 160 to 200 km/h.",
        "This is the speed that the Pendolino train with tilting body technology now reaches between the cities of Prague and České Budějovice. However, this speed is not maintained along the entire route, but only on two sections of corridor IV that were put into operation in 2022.",
        "We are talking about a 17-kilometer section from Sudoměřice to Votice, where tilting trains can reach speeds of up to 200 km/h, and regular trains can reach speeds of up to 170 km/h, as well as a 9-kilometer section from Soběslav to Doubí (200 km/h and 185 km/h).",
        "The fastest in history Czech railway journey departed from Prague for the first time on Sunday at 8:27 p.m. During the trip, it reached a speed of 200 km/h twice.",

        "The Southern Express Pendolino will operate between cities daily. The travel time is now 95 minutes for the evening trip and 90 minutes for the morning trip. This is 11 minutes faster than before.",
        "\"The increase of the existing speed limit for us is more than just an operational change - it is a symbolic opening of a new chapter in the history of Czech railways. Efficient reduction of travel time is one of our priorities,\" said Jiri Svoboda, the head of the Czech Railways Transport Management.",
        "According to him, by the end of the year, a detailed plan will be presented to increase the speed limit on the České Budějovice - Linz section to 230 km/h.",
        "\"Of course, it is important to utilize the potential of the IV corridor, into which a lot has been invested. But it is also important as a symbolic message to the Czech public that things are changing, that faster connections between Czech cities are not a distant dream but a reality,\" said Minister of Transport Martin Kupka.",
        "He added that the next acceleration should take place on the Brno-Przerov route, where another section of track is already being created, allowing speeds of up to 200 km/h. Modern ComfortJet trains with new high-speed Vectron locomotives will operate on it, capable of reaching speeds of up to 230 kilometers per hour.",
