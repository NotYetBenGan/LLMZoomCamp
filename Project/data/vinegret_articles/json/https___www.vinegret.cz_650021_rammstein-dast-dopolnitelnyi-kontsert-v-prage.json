        "The iconic German band Rammstein will perform in Prague again. All tickets for the previously announced concert on May 15th are already sold out, so the musicians have decided to hold another concert on May 16th. Both performances will take place outdoors at the Letňany aerodrome.",
        "Tickets at the price of 1990 crowns can be purchased through the Ticketportal network. All of them are personalized (you need to specify the name when purchasing), which means they cannot be transferred to another person.",
        "The last time Rammstein performed in Prague was in 2019. The demand was also high back then - the band played a second concert the day after the first one, filling the \"EDEN Arena\" stadium to capacity.",
        "The musicians promise to present a new album, but it won't be complete without some timeless hits.",
