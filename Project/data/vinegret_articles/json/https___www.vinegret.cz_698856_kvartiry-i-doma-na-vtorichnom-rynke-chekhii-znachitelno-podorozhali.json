        "In 2024, the cost of secondary housing has increased in almost all regions of the Czech Republic. Apartments have become more expensive throughout the country, with significant increases in some regions. The exception was private houses in the Karlovy Vary region, which decreased in price by 8% over the year. This information comes from a study conducted by the \"EHS\" group of companies, based on data from the Bezrealitky advertising platform and the Maxima real estate agency, as reported by ČTK.",
        "Secondary apartments in good condition have increased in price by an average of 9% to 100,941 kroner per square meter. The cost of renting apartments in old buildings has also increased - by an average of the same 9% to 328 kroner per square meter. Prices for private houses have risen by 7% to 57,902 kroner per square meter.",
        "The main reason for the price increase was the increased demand. Last year, the economic situation in the Czech Republic slightly improved compared to previous years - the middle class representatives started to feel more confident and were more willing to take out mortgages, especially since the interest rates on them decreased.",
        "Prices for old Prague apartments in good condition have been growing moderately for most of the year and by the end of the fourth quarter reached 134,696 crowns per square meter, which is 5% higher compared to the third quarter and 8% higher year-on-year. A significant pressure on prices was exerted by the increasing number of interested buyers - since the beginning of the year, it has roughly tripled.",
        "Private houses in Prague were mostly sold in two categories: properties in poor condition before reconstruction on the outskirts of the city and expensive villas in prestigious areas. The average price for private houses was 114,280 crowns per square meter, which is 6% higher than a year ago.",
        "High prices make people reduce their demands and look for housing not in the very Prague, but in its outskirts. Last year, the number of apartment buyers in the Central Bohemian Region increased by 2-5 times depending on the specific locality and location of the property. The highest demand was for apartments located near a railway station with direct connection to Prague and a maximum of an hour's drive to the city center.",
        "There has been some revival in local demand, especially in the cities of Kladno, Beroun, Neratovice, Roudnice-nad-Labem, Brandys-nad-Labem, Lysa-nad-Labem, and Nymburk. By the end of the year, the average price for apartments there was 84920 Czech crowns per square meter, which is 11% higher compared to the previous year. Prices for private houses, however, remained unchanged at around 70,000 crowns per square meter.",
        "Demand for secondary real estate has tripled in Brno, as well as in the entire South Moravian region. Prices for apartments there reached 95,000 CZK per square meter, which is 16% higher than a year ago. The cost of private houses in Brno has increased to 56,822 CZK per square meter.",
        "Over the past year, the rent for secondary housing has increased. In Prague, the average rental rate was 401 crowns per square meter, which is 10% higher compared to the previous year.",
