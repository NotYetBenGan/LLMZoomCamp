        "The entrance to the Žižkov Tunnel in Prague has been decorated with panels of distorted mirrors, or more precisely, polished to a shine steel sheets, which create an interesting play of light and reflections.",
        "The piece titled \"reflexe_zrcadlení\" was created by Vit Šimek from the Atelier HRA studio.",
        "His work won an art competition announced by the municipal district of Prague-3 in 2023.",
        "The grand opening of the art object took place on the evening of Thursday, September 4th.",
        "\"The project aims to create a permanent interactive art piece that will become part of the public space of Takhovskaya Square. The mirrored walls bring more light, space, and dynamism to an otherwise quite narrow corridor leading to the tunnel.\"",
        "\"The artwork interacts with both a person coming from Karlin and with a pedestrian or cyclist moving in the opposite direction,\" the author explained.",
