        "Action star and legendary hero of internet memes Chuck Norris will visit Prague. The American actor will take part in the event \"Weekend with a Legend,\" which will be held on November 22 and 23, 2025 at the House of Fun Prague venue in the Máj shopping center.",
        "In addition to 85-year-old Norris, other celebrity guests will also take part in it. Their names will be announced later. This was reported to journalists on Tuesday, September 9, by Petr Vetrovsky, a representative of the organizing company VDN Promo.",
        "\"We conducted a survey to see who to invite to the tenth anniversary of our agency, and Norris won by a huge margin. He is popular thanks to his career and perhaps because of the jokes circulating about him. Fans will be able to purchase not only a photograph but also an autograph on items they bring,\" he said.",
        "As part of the event, Norris will talk to the audience about his career, answer questions, and also hold a photo and autograph session.",
        "Tickets are already on sale on the Goout website.",
        "The price for a seat in the audience ranges from 990 to 1290 kroner, while for a VIP ticket (including a photo with the star and an autograph) you will have to pay 4990 kroner. Participation in the autograph session alone costs 3990 kroner.",
        "\"The Weekend with a Legend\" is a continuation of the previous event \"Night with a Legend\", during which a meeting with Jean-Claude Van Damme took place in Prague.",
