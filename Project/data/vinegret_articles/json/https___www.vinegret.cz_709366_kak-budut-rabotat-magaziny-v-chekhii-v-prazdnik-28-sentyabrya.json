        "In the Czech Republic, the first autumn holiday is approaching - Czech Statehood Day, traditionally celebrated on September 28th and dedicated to the memory of Saint Wenceslas. In 2025, it falls on a Sunday.",
        "On this day, all major stores will be closed. Residents and guests of the republic should take this fact into account to avoid running into closed supermarket doors.",
        "\"Why is it like this?\"",
        "Since October 2016, there has been a law in the Czech Republic that prohibits large stores (with an area of more than 200 m²) from operating on certain public holidays. This is done so that supermarket employees, like other residents, can spend at least some holidays with their families.",
        "The measure applies to all large stores, not just grocery stores.",
        "The Day of the Slavic Saints Cyril and Methodius, as well as the Day of the Execution of Jan Hus (July 6), are not included in the list of holidays when supermarkets are prohibited from operating. Therefore, on July 5 and 6, they will be open to shoppers according to their regular schedule.",
        "During these public holidays, the stores should be closed.",
        "During these public holidays, the stores DO NOT close.",
        "Shopping centers are not required to close on \"restricted days\", but large stores under their roof are. Therefore, shopping centers are often open on holidays, but shopping becomes meaningless.",
        "Exceptions to the law are also made for stores at train stations, airports, hospitals, pharmacies, gas stations, and wholesale stores (in particular MAKRO). They are allowed to operate regardless of the area.",
