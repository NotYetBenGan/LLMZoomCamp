        "In the first quarter of 2025, the cost of renting apartments in the Czech Republic increased on average by 5% compared to the previous quarter, reaching 361 Czech crowns per square meter. The highest growth was observed in the regions. This is especially noticeable in the Usti Region, where prices increased by 9% immediately.",
        "In Prague, rental prices have increased by 4%. At the same time, the capital remains a place with the highest prices and the highest demand for rentals. These are the findings of a study by the popular online advertising platform Bezrealitky.cz, which was reviewed by the ČTK agency.",
        "In Prague, landlords were asking on average 429 Czech crowns per square meter in the first quarter. The most expensive in terms of per square meter were apartments with small layouts of 1+kk and 2+kk, while large apartments turned out to be the cheapest. An average \"family\" apartment with an area of 65 square meters was rented out on average for 27,876 crowns.",
        "Although the number of people interested in renting housing in the capital has slightly decreased, the demand still remained high - on average, about 85 people responded to one listing. However, it is worth considering that applicants usually view several properties simultaneously.",
        "In the Central Bohemian Region, on the other hand, rental rates decreased by 2% compared to the previous quarter and averaged 300 crowns per square meter. A typical 65 m² apartment here was rented out for 19,300 crowns. The most expensive areas were those bordering Prague, with direct railway connections - there prices were comparable to residential districts in Prague.",
        "In Brno and its surroundings, rental rates have stabilized. After a sharp increase last year, in the first quarter of 2025, they stopped at 329 crowns per square meter. A typical family apartment in Brno was rented out for 24,300 crowns. On average, about 50 interested parties responded to each listing here, with small apartments being in highest demand.",
        "The demand for rental housing in the Czech Republic remains high, however, according to Bezrealitky, the situation is starting to improve. Finding a suitable apartment or tenant now takes about twice as long as it did several years ago.",
        "\"There is a belief that owners will be able to invite interested parties for a viewing within a few days after posting the listing, but the reality is usually different. Today, the average waiting time for the first viewing is about two weeks,\" noted Martin Ponzer, the head of Bezrealitky.cz.",
