        "The Slovak police have registered, apparently, a record overload of a passenger and compact car Škoda Felicia. Law enforcement officers stopped it in the east of the country during routine road patrols and could not believe their eyes - there were 18 people in the cabin. Moreover, the man behind the wheel did not have a driver's license.",
        "\"Incredibly, but this is reality. The car designed for five people was packed to the brim,\" the police reported on their Facebook page, accompanying the post with the headline \"How many people can fit in a Škoda Felicia? The answer will shock you!\"",
        "The police warned that driving in such conditions is a risk to the life and health of everyone in the car.",
        "The driver was fined for a traffic violation and prohibited from continuing driving. All passengers had to continue their journey on foot.",
        "The Felicia model was produced by the Czech company Škoda, which was already part of the Volkswagen group, from 1994 to 2001 as a successor to the \"pre-revolutionary\" Favorit model, on the basis of which it was developed. In total, more than 1.4 million units were produced, which remained the most common cars on Czech roads for many years after production ended.",
