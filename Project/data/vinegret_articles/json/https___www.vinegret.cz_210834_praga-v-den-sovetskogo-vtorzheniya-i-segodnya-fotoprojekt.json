        "In 2018, Czech photographer Martin Škrabálek published an interesting project to commemorate the anniversary of the Warsaw Pact troops' invasion of Czechoslovakia. He combined archival photos of Prague taken in the early days of the invasion with images of the modern city.",
        "The resulting collages allow the viewer to touch upon those events, to imagine themselves in that situation and to reflect on the shock that the residents of Prague experienced when hundreds of tanks and thousands of soldiers entered their beautiful and peaceful city.",
