        "Hello! We are a team of licensed RE/MAX realtors in Prague, and our main goal is to make the process of buying or selling real estate as simple and understandable for you as possible.",
        "We have been working since 2008 and are well acquainted with all the nuances of the Czech market. It is especially important that we are able to handle transactions completely remotely - so whether it's a sale or a purchase, you won't have to come in person, we will take care of everything for YOU!",
        "We carefully plan all steps in advance and take on the responsibility of solving complex issues so that you feel confident and calm at every stage.",
        "Modern tools, European standards, and support from the international agency RE/MAX allow us to achieve the best results and save your time.",
        "Do you want to make sure? Watch our videos on YouTube, Instagram, or read reviews on Google by searching for \"Real estate agent in Prague\".",
        "Why might your apartment in Prague not sell even in a growing market?",
        "At first glance, today is a great moment to sell an apartment in Prague. Mortgage rates are gradually decreasing, and demand is very high again.",
        "However, more and more often we are approached by owners who have been unable to sell their property for several months. Although the apartment is good, the area is promising, and the price seems reasonable. What went wrong?",
        "Error #1: assessment \"by eye\"",
        "To put up an apartment as a reference \"like the neighbor's, but better\" is a direct path to failure.",
        "We approach pricing differently. Our free evaluation includes an analysis of completed transactions in your house and neighborhood (cadastral data), monitoring of active listings (your competitors), consideration of liquidity and rental potential based on dozens of transactions we have conducted.",
        "The evaluation is free and takes no more than 24 hours. You will only need to provide the following information: address, floor, square footage, layout details, presence of a balcony, storage room, and parking availability.",
        "Error #2: the advertisement is not engaging.",
        "An advertisement is a shop window: if the visual doesn't catch the eye, no one will come inside. What do we do to make the advertisement look professional?",
        "‚úÖ Home staging - decorating the interior of an apartment before photographing. We use our own decor or hire a specialized company for large properties.",
        "‚úÖ Professional photos and videos from a photographer who specializes exclusively in real estate shoots, knows which angles look best in listings or on video.",
        "‚úÖ We use graphics and 3D visualization when it is necessary to show the future state of real estate (for example, when an apartment is still under construction or renovation is needed).",
        "And all of this is ABSOLUTELY FREE for you. We earn our commission only upon the successful completion of the deal, so we are highly motivated to work quickly and efficiently.",
        "Error #3: Your real estate is not visible.",
        "You would be surprised how many sales channels are currently underestimated and unused by realtors and even real estate agencies due to lack of resources or the rigidity of employees who are used to working in the old-fashioned way only through the well-known portal Sreality.cz.",
        "We use both traditional and modern promotion channels. We actively cooperate with other realtors because our goal is to sell quickly and profitably for the client, and we are always ready to share our commission. It would be beneficial.",
        "‚ùóÔ∏è Important: why should you choose our team specifically for selling your real estate or finding a property for purchase?",
        "What does \"two agents for one client\" mean?",
        "One realtor is always available - even if the other is on vacation, with kids, in a deal, or just can't keep up with answering questions.",
        "Views, documents, negotiations - everything is duplicated, backed up, and checked.",
        "We do not finish work at the moment of signing the contract.",
        "If you:",
        "üìû Our contacts:",
        "Phone / WhatsApp: +420 775 775 895",
        "Telegram: @Dina_real_estate_agent_prague",
        "Sincerely,"
