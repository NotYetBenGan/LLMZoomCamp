        "The press service of Prague's Václav Havel Airport has issued a warning about scammers who are spreading false messages on social media on behalf of the air hub. These messages claim that forgotten suitcases left by passengers, which have not been claimed for a long time, are being sold off.",
        "The goal of the criminals is to steal access to the bank cards and accounts of trusting users. To do this, they use Facebook profiles that outwardly resemble the real page of Prague Airport.",
        "Such messages have been appearing periodically since 2022. Moreover, often, criminals use the paid promotion feature to increase the reach of their posts. Facebook is notorious for its extremely inaccurate moderation - it blocks harmless ads while letting fraudulent ones through, which cybercriminals take advantage of.",
        "The Prague airport emphasizes that it does not deal with the sale of forgotten luggage and has called on users to be vigilant.",
        "\"In the social network Facebook, a fraudulent profile pretending to be Prague Airport has reappeared, offering to sell luggage. We warn that this is in no way the profile of our company, as the airport does not sell luggage. If you encounter such a profile, please exercise increased vigilance and report it through the social network's tools,\" the airport warning says.",
