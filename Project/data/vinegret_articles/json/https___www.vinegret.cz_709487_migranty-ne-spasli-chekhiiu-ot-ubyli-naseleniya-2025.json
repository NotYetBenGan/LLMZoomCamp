        "👶 From January to June, 37,435 babies were born in the republic. In year-on-year comparison, the number of newborns decreased by 4,872 or 12%. The decline in birth rate has been continuing for the fourth year in a row. The number of children born to married women (19.7 thousand) and unmarried women (17.7 thousand) decreased equally.",

        "The negative migration balance at the Czech Statistical Office was explained by the departure of a large number of Ukrainian refugees whose temporary protection status expired on March 31, and for various reasons they did not extend it. A similar situation was observed a year earlier.",
