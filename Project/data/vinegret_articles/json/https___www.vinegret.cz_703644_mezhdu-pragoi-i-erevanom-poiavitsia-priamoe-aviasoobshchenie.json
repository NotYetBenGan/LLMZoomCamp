        "The carrier's plane will fly between the cities year-round three times a week - on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.",
        "The departure time from Prague is 20:25, from Yerevan - 17:35. The flight duration will be approximately 4 hours.",
        "Tickets are already on sale. The cost of a one-way flight starts at 1050 kronor.",
        "The route will be served by an Airbus A321neo aircraft designed for 239 passengers.",
        "Let's remind you that in the past, WizzAir already flew from Prague to Yerevan - from June to mid-September 2023. However, the low-cost airline then suddenly discontinued this route.",
        "The vacated space was immediately attempted to be taken over by the now non-existent \"Czech Airlines\". However, the launch of the flight was postponed several times and in the end, the company decided not to proceed with it.",
