        "Exactly 57 years ago, on August 21, 1968, the troops of five Warsaw Pact countries (USSR, Poland, Hungary, East Germany, and Bulgaria) invaded Czechoslovakia to put an end to the liberal reforms of the Prague Spring led by Alexander Dubcek.",
        "The military operation initiated by the Soviet leadership was named \"Danube\". According to official data, it claimed the lives of 137 Czechoslovak citizens in four months, with over 500 civilians sustaining serious injuries.",
        "Today, commemorative events will take place throughout the Czech Republic.",
        "In Prague at 11:00, a wreath-laying ceremony will take place at the building of the \"Czech Radio\", where several unarmed demonstrators were killed in August 1968 while protesting against the invasion. The event will be attended by Prime Minister Petr Fiala, the mayor of the city Boguslav Svoboda, the speakers of both chambers of parliament, and other prominent politicians.",
        "A free concert by NeverMore 68 will take place at the Výstaviště exhibition complex from 14:00 to 23:30, drawing parallels between the events of 1968 and the current Russian invasion of Ukraine.",
