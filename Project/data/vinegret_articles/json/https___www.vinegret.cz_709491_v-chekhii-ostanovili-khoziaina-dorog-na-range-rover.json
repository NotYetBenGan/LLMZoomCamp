        "Czech police stopped a black Range Rover Sport SUV whose driver was enjoying the right of priority passage on the D1 highway using a blue flashing light on the windshield, which, however, he had no authority to use.",
        "The incident occurred on August 20th. Eyewitnesses reported a suspicious car to the police. Patrol officers tracked it down and stopped it in the village of Petrovice (Vysočina region).",
        "They quickly found out that the 44-year-old driver has 19 penalty points on his driving record for various traffic violations. In the past, his driver's license has been revoked 9 times.",
        "According to the law, unauthorized use or imitation of a special signal can result in a fine of up to 25,000 crowns and a ban on driving a vehicle for up to 6 months. This type of offense cannot be resolved on the spot - it must always be decided by an administrative authority.",
        "\"The man denied any wrongdoing during the inspection, including the use of a blue flashing light, and behaved very arrogantly towards the police officers,\" said Dana Chirtkova, a representative of the regional police.",
        "However, further investigation revealed that the driver was lying. After a call through the media to law enforcement, several witnesses of the incident came forward and provided testimonies.",
        "\"Six drivers turned to the police, providing important testimonies about the driving style of this vehicle, and recordings from dashcams that captured the movement of this car with the emergency lights on,\" Chirtkova added.",
        "Now the incorrigible offender has every chance of losing their driver's license for the tenth time.",
