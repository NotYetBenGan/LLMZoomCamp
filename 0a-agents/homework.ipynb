      "answer: It is an internet connectivity error, terraform is somehow not able to access the online registry. Check your VPN/Firewall settings (or just clear cookies or restart your network). Try terraform init again after this, it should work.\n",

      "question: Docker: container crashed with status code 137.\n",
      "answer: It means your container consumed all available RAM allocated to it. It can happen in particular when working on Question#3 in the homework as the dataset is relatively large and containers eat a lot of memory in general.\n",
      "I would recommend restarting your computer and only starting the necessary processes to run the container. If that doesn’t work, allocate more resources to docker. If also that doesn’t work because your workstation is a potato, you can use an online compute environment service like GitPod, which is free under under 50 hours / month of use.\n",
